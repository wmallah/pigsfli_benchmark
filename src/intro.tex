% What is quantum computing?
%% Rewrite long quote in my owns words
Richard Feynman was the first to conceptualize the idea of using a quantum mechanical system to perform calculations. Not only would this machine be able to perform calculation, but it would also be capable of simulating physical quantum mechanical problems. "Feynman further analyzed that quantum computers can solve quantum mechanical many body problems that are impractical to solve on a classical computer. This is due to the fact that solutions on a classical computer would require exponentially growing time whereas the whole calculations on quantum computer can be done in polynomial time" (Prashant, 7). It was then later discovered by Deutsch, a man whose name is sprinkled through many aspects of quantum computing methods and algorithms, that a general-purpose quantum computer is theoretically possible. Moreover, he "showed that any physical process, in principle could be modelled perfectly by a quantum computer" (Prashant, 7).

The first major application of quantum computation was discovered by Peter Shor, famous for Shor's factorization algorithm: this algorithm was used to successfully factor huge numbers quickly. Since all information on classical computers is kept safe through encryption methods of factoring large prime numbers, this breakthrough gained the attention of many around the world.

% What is entanglement entropy?
One measurement that is of particular interest in quantum computation is entanglement entropy: "Entanglement entropy is a measure of how quantum information is stored in a quantum state" (Hartman, 166).

% Introduction to the work I did over the summer
During the summer of 2023, I worked with Dr. Adrian Del Maestro and his research group at the University of Tennessee Knoxville while attending one of their Research Experience for Undergradutes (REU) programs titled Quantum Alogorithms and Optimization (QAO). During this experience, I worked on benchmarking their algorithm for simulating identical, interacting bosons on a lattice. More specifically, I worked with the small scale (2 particles on 2 sites) in order to confidently extend the simulation to higher scale (larger system sizes).
