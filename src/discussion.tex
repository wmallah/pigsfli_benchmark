\subsection{PIGSFLI Algorithm}

A Monte Carlo simulation is a stochastic (random) method of integration, which allows for accurate estimations of desired values. Monte Carlo is necessary for situations where exact calculations are too computationally expensive, such as in the exact diagonalization of the reduced density matrix for high particle/site number Bose Hubbard systems. The size of the Hilbert space is calculated by \cref{eq:36} and shown by \cref{fig:hilbert_space_size}:

\begin{equation}
D = \frac{\left(N+L-1\right)!}{\left(N\right)!\left(L-1\right)!}
\label{eq:36}
\end{equation}

This plot shows excellent agreement between the PIGSFLI estimation and that of our ED calculation, showing that PIGSFLI is a viable option for computation on much larger system sizes.}
