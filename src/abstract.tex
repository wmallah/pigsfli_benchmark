Although quantum computation is still in the early stages, there are several promising architectures. One of these quantum computing architectures uses Rydberg atoms as qubits. Rydberg atoms, a specific type of Boson, as qubits on a chip, can be modeled by the Bose-Hubbard model. For this reason, we investigated the Bose-Hubbard model. More specifically, we benchmarked code written to simulate this system to determine its accuracy at low scales for extension to higher scale systems. In doing so, it was found that the code operates successfully for the 2 particle, 2 site system. Therefore, we can use the code on higher scale systems with high confidence in the accuracy of its results. Additionally, machine learning models can be implemented to speed up the estimations of desired values within the algorithm.
