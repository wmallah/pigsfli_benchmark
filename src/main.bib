	abstract = {Quantum theory is one of the most successful theories that have influenced the course of scientific progress during the twentieth century. It has presented a new line of scientific thought, predicted entirely inconceivable situations and influenced several domains of modern technologies. There are many different ways for expressing laws of science in general and laws of physics in particular. Similar to physical laws of nature, information can also be expressed in different ways. The fact that information can be expressed in different ways without losing its essential nature, leads for the possibility of the automatic manipulation of information.
All ways of expressing information use physical system, spoken words are conveyed by air pressure fluctuations: “No information without physical representation”. The fact that information is insensitive to exactly how it is expressed and can be freely translated from one form to another, makes it an obvious candidate for fundamentally important role in physics, like interaction, energy, momentum and other such abstractors. This is a project report on the general attributes of Quantum Computing and Information Processing from a layman’s point of view.},

D-Wave quantum computer has been available for more than eight years. IBM has made its quantum computer accessible via its cloud service. Also, Microsoft, Google, Intel, and NASA have been heavily investing in the development of quantum computers and their applications. The quantum computer seems to be no longer just for physicists and computer scientists, but also for information system researchers. This paper introduces the basic concepts of quantum computing and describes well-known quantum applications for non-physicists. The current status of the developments in quantum computing is also presented.},

	title = {Quantum {Computing}: {Vision} and {Challenges}},
	abstract = {The recent development of quantum computing, which makes use of entanglement, superposi- tion, and other quantum fundamental concepts, has the ability to provide substantial processing advantages over traditional computing. These quantum features help solve many hard problems that cannot be solved with traditional computing methods. These problems are in areas like modeling quantum mechanics, logistics, making chemical-based advances, designing drugs, statistical science, sustainable energy, banking, reliable communication, and quantum chemical engineering. The last few years have witnessed remarkable advancements in quantum software and algorithm creation as well as quantum hardware research, which have significantly advanced the prospect of the realization of quantum computers. It would be helpful to have comprehensive literature research on this area to grasp the current status and find outstanding problems that require considerable attention from the research community working in the quantum computing industry. To better understand quantum computing, this paper examines the foundations and vision based on current research in this area. We discuss cutting-edge developments in quantum computer hardware advancement, and subsequent advances in quantum cryptography, quantum software, and high-scalability quantum computers. Many potential challenges and exciting new trends for quantum technology research and development are highlighted in this paper for a wider debate.},

	abstract = {These notes, based on lectures given at various schools over the last few years, aim to provide an introduction to entanglement entropies in quantum field theories, including holographic ones. We explore basic properties and simple examples of entanglement entropies, mostly in two dimensions, with an emphasis on physical rather than formal aspects of the sub- ject. In the holographic case, the focus is on how the Ryu-Takayanagi formula geometrically realizes general features of field-theory entanglement, while revealing special properties of holographic theories. In order to make the notes somewhat self-contained for readers whose background is in high-energy theory, a brief introduction to the relevant aspects of quantum information theory is included.},

	abstract = {A ground state path integral quantum Monte Carlo algorithm is introduced that allows for the simulation of lattice bosons at zero temperature. The method is successfully bench- marked against the one dimensional Bose-Hubbard model through comparison with the po- tential and kinetic energy computed via exact diagonalization. After successful validation, an estimator is introduced to measure the Rényi entanglement entropy between spatial sub- regions which is explored across the phase diagram of the one dimensional Bose-Hubbard model for systems consisting of up to L = 256 sites at unit-filling, far beyond the reach of exact diagonalization. The favorable scaling of the algorithm is demonstrated through a further measurement of the Rényi entanglement entropy at the two dimensional superfluid- insulator critical point for large system sizes, confirming the existence of the expected en- tanglement boundary law in the ground state. The Rényi estimator is extended to measure the symmetry resolved entanglement that is operationally accessible as a resource.},

	abstract = {We study the entanglement R ́enyi α-entropy (ERαE) as the measure of entanglement. Instead of a single quantity in standard entanglement quantification for a quantum state by using the von Neumann entropy for the well-accepted entanglement of formation (EoF), the ERαE gives a continuous spectrum parametrized by variable α as the entanglement measure, and it reduces to the standard EoF in the special case α → 1. The ERαE provides more information in entanglement quantification, and can be used such as in determining the convertibility of entangled states by local operations and classical communication. A series of new results are obtained: (i) we can show that ERαE of two states, which can be mixed or pure, may be incomparable, in contrast to the fact that there always exists an order for EoF of two states; (ii) similar as the case of EoF, we study in a fully analytical way the ERαE for arbitrary two-qubit states, the Werner states and isotropic states in general d-dimension; (iii) we provide a proof of the previous conjecture for the analytical functional form of EoF of isotropic states in arbitrary d-dimension.},
